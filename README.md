# DevTool_React

Chrome extension project with a React-powered popup.

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start development build with file watching:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Create a production build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The compiled extension files will be output to the `dist/` directory. Load this folder as an unpacked extension in Chrome to test the build.
